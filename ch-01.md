## My Comments:
The well accepted translation of the two opening lines is to me, foolishness.
To say that the Dao that can be explained is not the eternal Dao, and then write a book explaining it, is nonsense.
To say that a name that can be named is not the eternal name is equally foolish, since in chapter X, he names it the Dao.

I believe that translation is so popular because people like unexplainable juxtaposition (St Augustine in particular), they create a mirage of unfathomable fiction through litteral paradox which acts as a barrier to finding deeper truth.
So, I changed them to what I believe was the original author's intent.

Its not that the Dao is unknowable, its that it is too fluid to define in a long term meaningful way.
You simply can't make life's little instruction book, and explain what to do in every situation, and define "the way".
The Way is not a list of instructions or commandments you must follow dogmatically.
Its is a living, thinking thing, and you can align yourself with, and emulate.

For the rest of the book, I call those who attempt to wend the Way "Daoists". Other translations call them sages.

the twins are the yin/yang sides of every phenominon.
Chapter 2 goes into the idea that they emerge together.

the idea here is that persuing the Way,
discovering the interactions of yin and yang,
and letting go of one's ego,
is a gateway to a wonderous new world,
with greatly rewarding philisophical depth lying below its surface.
