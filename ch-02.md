# 2nd Chapter

| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 天 下 | everywhere under heaven: |
| 皆 知 美 之 為 美 斯 惡 已 | when beauty is formed, all can distinguish beauty from ugliness |
| 皆 知 善 之 為 善 斯 不 善 已 | when quality is crafted, all can distinguish quality from common |
| 故 | therefore |
| 有 無 相 生 | haves and have-nots each-other create |
| 難 易 相 成 | easy and hard each-other explain |
| 長 短 相 較 | long and short each-other contrast |
| 高 下 相 傾 | above and below on each-other are stacked |
| 音 聲 相 和 | melody and harmony each-other require |
| 前 後 相 隨 | front and back after each-other transpire |
| 是 以 聖 人 | and so, the Daoists... |
| 處 無 為 之 事 | live-life without-effort to manage it |
| 行 不 言 之 教 | go about not-lecturing to teach it |
| 萬 物 作 焉 而 不 辭 | the 10k-things in motion but not interupting |
| 生 而 不 有 | creating but not owning |
| 為 而 不 恃 | producing but not claiming |
| 功 成 而 弗 居 | finishing tasks but not lingering |
| 夫 唯 弗 居 | this simple non-lingering |
| 是 以 不 去 | is why its non-diminishing |

## My Comments:
May translations seem to imply that the opening lines to this chapter are an invitation to let go of ideas like beauty because they come with "ugly" baggage.
This concept that distinguishing things from their opposites is some how mean and discriminating is wrong-think.

As is made obvious by the original test, as well as rest of the book (and even the rest of this chapter), the opening statements are simply the observation that the two things emerge-together.
to unwind that distinction between quality and junk, beauty and ugliness is to unwind the work of the Dao.  For the Dao created 1, and the 1 created the 2 (the dao gives rise to both yin and yang).
the Way of the Way is to understand the differences between yin and yang, not to ignore them.

How this connects to the "so the Daoists" section is a bit of a stretch.
It appears to me that the idea is that, since there is both yin and yang, and they are everywhere and in everything,
wise people will let go of many concerns of life, since some times things will be yin and sometimes yang, and if you don't fight that, things will eventually fix itself.
