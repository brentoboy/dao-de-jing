## My Comments:
What I have translated as "doing without deeds". is the heart of "Wu wei", the philosophy of non-action that is associated with Daoism.
It is commonly translated as "acting without action" or "practicing non-action" or "doing without effort".

I don't like the translations that treat the second "do" as a verb, and the "無" as a negation of a verb.
throughout the book, 無 is used to describe the yin state of "lacking" or "being without" something, as opposed to verb negation.
It generally applies to the noun that follows it.
which means, the 為 after the "without" isn't a verb "to do" it is the thing that is done. .. "the deed".

In daoist philosophy, "deeds" lead to "fame" or "recognition" or making a name for one's self.
This "doing without deeds" is more in-line with the philosophy of creating without claiming.
And it moves away from the philisophical paradox of doing non-doing that is the root of so much foolishness.
Daoism is minimalism, not laziness; it is Non-recognition, not anti-accomplishment.

To manage without managing, or to do without doing, or teach without teaching, or govern without governing, in order to emulate the "Dao" and lay claim on its "Virtue" is mirage-philosophy.

The Dao is constantly "doing" things like creating, giving-life, sustaining things.
The De is constantly virtious by "doing" things like nurturing, sheltering, shielding, feeding, etc.

Its not about not doing things, its about doing them with no strings attached.
