## My Comments:
I'm not entirly sure how the two halves of this chapter relate.

the second half is really quite interesting.
I think it is saying that...
the area above the earth, below the sky (the biosphere)
might be empty, but when you begin pumping the bellows (the various cycles that exist ... like the seasons, the days, the tides, the wind, weather patterns)
what happens is kindeling new life, much like a bellows fanning the flames of life.

and then things get really interesting.
he says ... I have something really interesting to say about that, but I dont think I could do it justice with words (saying more would only distract from what I'm about to say...)
"Unlike watching the center"
watching the center (I think) means ... turning your attention towards your core/center/inner self ...
I think he's saying ...
"try cycling the bellows of the body (the lungs) and focus your attention on your own in-between, and see what gets kindled."
