## My Comments:
I believe that the "valley" methaphor in Daoism is the central core of the body.
It is the inner universe.  (as opposed to the outer universe ... the "heaven and earth")
As a person meditates, the rain falls from the heavens, and runs down the mountains, into the valley.
The valley being in the lower dan-tien ... a gathering place of chi energy, a little below the navel.
The valley is a mysterious container that holds .. I guess chi energy.
And just like the valley between heaven and earth (the biosphere) can contain unbelievable amounts of chi energy,
so can your inner universe.
And, that doing so isn't really that hard.
