# Chapter 7
## Rejuvination via Self Sacrifice

| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 天 長 地 久 | the heavens are eternal, the earth enduring |
| 天 地 所 以 能 長 且 久 者 | heaven-and-earth live such that they can be eternal and enduring |
| 以 其 不 自 生 | because they are not self life-giving |
| 故 能 長 生 | and so can be eternally life-having |
| 是 以 聖 人 | And so, the Daoists... |
| 後 其 身 而 身 先 | last-place their life-needs but life-needs met-first |
| 外 其 身 而 身 存 | away-give thier body-life but body-life survive-remains |
| 非 以 其 無 私 邪 | Is it not by means of their self-less actions |
| 故 能 成 其 私 | that they fulfil thier own needs? |


## My Comments:
there is a strange contradiction going on here, and I'm not sure if the question posed in the last two lines is intended to be paradoxical or if it just reads that way to me.
it seems to ask ... are they selfless for selfish reasons?

the principle being taught in this chapter is...
serving others rejuvinates you
and as evidence, we see that heaven and earth, which continually serve the 10k things and the 100-familes, with no strings attached .. seem to have infinite lifespans.
we can also see that selfless people seem to have enough and to spare.

which creates that final interesting question.
does a person who knows this principle, and serves others rather than seeking their own best interest .. actually doing it for thier own best interest?
