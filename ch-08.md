## My Comments:
I'm not sure what is virtuous about some of these things.
Various other chapters speak of the great virtues as being self sacrificing deeds, without seeking recognition for your service.
Much like water flowing down a hill toward the valley, and all it touches is filled with life.
and then the water goes and sits in the lowliest of habitations (by its very nature it rests in the lowest place it can find.)

I can see how each of these is valuable, and perhaps good advice.
but the examples of virtuous living dont go well with the water metaphore.
they almost define a different definition of virtue that contradicts the first.
