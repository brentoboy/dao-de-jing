## My Comments:

the message here seems to be...
if you take something to its full "yang" state .. complete achievement ... done-ness.
the only path forward is for it to come undone.

so there is no need to wait for the cup to fill all the way to the top
or to plan out every detail of some project (since it wont go as planned anyway)
collecting wealth, or fame ... just to watch it go away ... pointless.

once you reach zenith, things go downhill from there
its the natural order of things.


I think it is saying... if you dont want to diminish, then dont rise above a certain level.
