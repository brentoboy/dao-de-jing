## My Comments:
This chapter was the one that convinced me that the original author really was talking about meditation in this and other chapters (like ch 6).  At first, I was sceptical.  But the imagry of moving qi around within the body, and opening the door of heaven and allowing it to fill you.  That really is the most likely actual intended meaning.
