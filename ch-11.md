## My Comments:
This chapter is a cute observation.
I wonder if it has deeper meaning, but I dont see any.

What I do see is that it makes a good case of the need for both yin and yang.
Each of the things that are listed have a presence of structure, and an absense of structure.
And the way the presence and absense work together is very useful.
Neither complete absense, nor complete presence would be as useful.
