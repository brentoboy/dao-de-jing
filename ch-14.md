## My Comments:
This is a beautiful chapter.
It explains how to come to know the Dao.

You cant use physical senses, because its non-physical. (you could say it is ethereal or spritual or whatever).
So, you must leave "science" behind, because it deals with things that can be measured or detected using the physical senses.

However, there's hope ... you can become aquainted with the Dao, the same way the ancient sages did:
The Way teaches its own history, to those who wend the Way.

I love the idea that the "Way of the Ancients" is to live in the present moment.
Instead of chasing the Dao, hoping to discover it, stop, be still, and let it reveal itself.
just don't expect it to be a "physical thing".

interestingly, to know "the Way" is to have an awareness of its history, which it gives you as you get to know it.
at least, that's how I'm interpreting what I see.
