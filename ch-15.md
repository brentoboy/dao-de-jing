## Be Still, Let the Fog Clear Itself

| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 古 之 善 為 士 者 微 妙 玄 通 | Anciently the virtious became masters of the subtle mysteries |
| 深 不 可 識 | the depths of which can't be understood |
| 夫 唯 不 可 識 | by itself it can't be understood |
| 故 強 為 之 容 | so instead, consider its manafestations |
| 豫 兮 若 冬 涉 川 | at ease! though winter-crossing the river |
| 猶 兮 若 畏 四 鄰 | keen! though surrounded by hazards |
| 儼 兮 其 若 客) | polite! its like a guest |
| 渙 兮 若 冰 之 將 釋 | fleeting! like ice as it melts away |
| 敦 兮 其 若 樸 | genuine! its like uncut wood |
| 曠 兮 其 若 谷 | wide open! its like a valley |
| 混 兮 其 若 濁 | vague! its like fog |
| 孰 能 濁 以 靜 之 徐 清 | who can, in the fog, be calm as it slowly clears up? |
| 孰 能 安 以 久 動 之 徐 生 | who can be still as the years slowly provide them new-life? |
| 保 此 道 | to secure this Way (path) |
| 者 不 欲 盈 | one must not seek brimming-fullness |
| 夫 唯 不 盈 | so instead, non-fullness |
| 故 以 能 蔽 而 不 成 | that which is able to maintain but not satisfy |


## My Comments:
The author recognizes that the thing he wants to describe (the Dao) is a thing that is difficult to describe directly.
The ancient sages learned its subtleties by living them.

So, he explains it with ideas we can relate to, that approach the attributes of the Dao.
And then, shifts to how to do what the ancients did (understand its subtleties by living them).

I'm not entirley confident that I captured what it is trying to say.
the fog that surrounds the Dao, will clear if you calmly wait for it to dissipate.
keeping one's consumption to only what is needed to sustain them, not enough to fulfill them.

I'm not entirly confident that brimming-fullness is about "consumption" (food / water / entertainment) but I dont see what else he might mean.
