## My Comments:
I find this chapter incredibly insiteful

I'm not sure if this is advice on how to manage things and people through overvation and careful restraint.
Or it if it is advice on how to step away from the crazy and observe your own thoughts and interests and understand them in order to become sovereign over yourself.

Perhaps this chapter (and others) is about the outer universe as well as the inner universe.
