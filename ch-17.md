## My Comments:
This chapter seems to be about "rulers"
The good the bad, and the untrustworthy.

i'm not sure how the transition from bad jumps to the good again.
But it definitly seems to do that.

the last two lines appear to be the attitude of the people, when a great ruler is governing the land.

I think the 3 preceeding lines are all about how we recognize the untrustworthy ruler.
(beware of leaders offering expensive promises)

The way I read this puts the ideal national leadership in this order (from best to worst)...

Greatest: someone you don't even think about

Good: someone who cares

Bad: a tyrant

Terrible: a socialist
