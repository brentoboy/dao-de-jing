## My Comments:
much of the ddj focuses on how yin causes yang, or how opposites precede one another
this one recognizes that likes congregate.

how, if we attempt to do, or have a particular attidude or characteristic,
that which has that characteristic will gather to us like family.

for instance, when we are trusting, others who are trusting will recognize that, and connect with us.
when we are virtuous, other virtuous things will want to be near us.
when we follow the way, others who do so will be drawn to us.

ultimately, the way itself will draw near to us when we are its kindred.
