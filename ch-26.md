## My Comments:
I'm still trying to decide how to interpet this.

At first, I thought it was out of sync with the rest of the book,
and that it was recommending that people let go of curiosity in favor of stability.
Which is very "grown up" attitude, but doesn't align with the attitude of the DDJ. 

But, now I'm thinking it might be saying the opposite.
Its saying that if we anchor ourselves to things,
and avoid moving when there's an opportunity,
then we will miss a glorious view of the birds,
just to protect our dumb wealth.

At first, I thought that the question ... who can stand against the big guns, and still be free?
was a riddle, and he would tell you the secret to being safe and free.

But, now I'm thinking it is not a rare magic attitude that gives you power over both.
Instead, it is a choice.  Do you want to be free? or safe?

Would you rather have an expensive car, or a glorious view of the birds?
