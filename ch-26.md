## My Comments:
I'm still trying to decide how to interpet this.

At first, I thought it was out of sync with the rest of the book,
and that it was recommending that people let go of curiosity in favor of stability.
Which is very "grown up" attitude, but doesn't align with the attitude of the DDJ. 

But, now I'm thinking it might be saying the opposite.
Its saying that if we anchor ourselves to things,
and avoid moving when there's an opportunity,
then we will miss a glorious view of the birds,
just to protect our dumb stuff.

And that you cant stand against the things that will destroy your fancy car.
So be spontaneous and movable, even at the cost of stability and influence.
