## My Comments:

... So, I dont think I unwound this all the way, its inconsistent with itself and it is dumb (as interpeted)

... on a positive note, the other translators are also all wet, and, in areas they act like they know what he meant, they are no where near the original symbols.  even Gia-Fu Feng, who's translations are normally very close to the original, and also quite understandable.

... it may be worth revisiting, but I dont "smell" some hidden nugget that I wish I could unravel.

what I think it says is ...
there are ways for a peasant to become the ruler.
but it shouldnt be by war,
because after the war, there is a leadership problem,
where the unqualified idiot focuses on "results" and "outputs" and stuff,
so everything gets cheap and crappy,
and no one builds anything thats made to last,
and that's just anti-dao ist.
