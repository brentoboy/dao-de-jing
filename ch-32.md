## My Comments:

this one is beatifully poetic

I wish it were also profound.

I mean, sure, its an interesting observation.
Heaven doesn't need to "lord over" the earth, their relationship is beatiful without one granting special honors and titles to the other.
Wouldn't life be great if people were like that.

I do think its interesting how "American" it is.
the idea of governing by individual equality.
that no man should be granted a title by the state.
